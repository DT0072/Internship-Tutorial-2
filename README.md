# Tour Of Heroes
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.0.5. **But I have make changes to turn it into an E-Commerce Store.**   


## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.  
 

## Code scaffolding
Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.  


## Build
Run `ng build` to build the project however to build the application and deploy the build artifacts elsewhere when ready the application is ready to deploy. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
